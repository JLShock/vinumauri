				<h4>2010 Vinum Auri Cabernet Sauvignon</h4>
				<p>95 pts. by WineGuyReviews.com</p>
				<p>This is a really Big Cab! First impressions of aromas include dark ripe fruit, cinnamon and nutmeg.  The palate is rewarded with smooth, silky flavors of sophisticated, lush, ripe, dark berries, featuring soft tannins with a long finish.  It is extremely approachable wine now and should gain additional complexity.  It will cellar well for the next 15+ years.</p>
				<p>Classic wines share one common thread together worldwide - an intimate relationship with the place they originate from.  Our inaugural Vinum Auri proudly shares this unique style, coming from the Rutherford appellation on the west side of Napa Valley.</p>

				<h4>2011 Vinum Auri Cabernet Sauvignon</h4>
				<p>“When a grape comes from the best dirt in Napa Valley (Rutherford, Sub AVA) you can’t help but capture the essence of a great wine in the nose, the first impression I get is dark, rich chocolate, fruit and hints of French oak which makes this wine deliciously food worthy in every sense."  Vic Bourassa, Vintner, Bourassa Vineyards.</p>
				<p>Rutherford’s soils are primarily gravel, sand and loam, and are dominated by volcanic deposits and Franciscan marine sediment. They provide excellent water drainage and ideal conditions for Cabernet Sauvignon. However, to us vignerons, the "dust" means much more than dirt. It is the combination of earth, special climate, meticulous fruit-focused winemaking and unrelenting patience that produces world-class wines, the 2011 Vinum Auri Cabernet Sauvignon is in this class and gets an A +. Heighten your pleasure by enjoying now through 2025.</p>
