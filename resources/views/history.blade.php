				<p>A group of successful businessmen got together with some of the finest winemakers in Napa Valley to create a new, high-brand wine, Vinum Auri.  The Latin translation for “Wine of Gold.”  After forming SBW Wine Group, LLC, the group developed, introduced, and released the inaugural vintage of 2010 Vinum Auri.</p>
				<p>One of the original founders, Vic Bourassa, is a long time Napa Valley vintner.  The turning point for Vic Bourassa, proprietor of Bourassa Vineyards in the Napa Valley, occurred over a lunch he had in 1999 with the godfather of California wine, Robert Mondavi.  The chance to talk about wine with one of the most influential winery figures in the world was to be savored and appreciated.  At some point during that memorable lunch Bourassa uncorked a bottle of his own homemade Napa Valley Pinot Noir and, after a few evidently pleasurable sips, Mondavi began to encourage the novice winemaker to enter the winemaking field as a professional.  It was at that very moment that Bourassa Vineyards was born.</p>
				<p>Bourassa's winemaking philosophy is simple: create something special, something that you would be proud to share with your friends.  The wines, no matter what the varietal, are painstakingly handcrafted in small lots.  The winery carefully creates rich, complex blends using grapes from premiere, hand-tended Napa Valley vineyards as they showcase the terroir that has become so well known throughout the world.</p>
				<p>Additionally, the group commissioned Gary Galleron to help consult in the process of making this Wine of Gold.  Gary Galleron grew up playing in the vineyards along Galleron Road, the street named for his French-immigrant grandparents who settled in the Napa Valley in 1918.  He has worked in the family vineyards since he was a child, learning every aspect of the wine industry literally from the ground up.</p>
				<p>Later attending and graduating from Cal State University Fresno with a degree in viticulture and enology in 1976, Gary went to work with Mike Grgich at Chateau Montelena gaining invaluable experience.  Since then, he has produced award-winning wines for some of the most prestigious wineries in the valley, including Whitehall Lane, Grace Family, Hartwell, Vineyard 29, Del Dotto Vineyards, Seavey and William Harrison Vineyards.</p>
				<p>Gary’s passion for his work (“It’s not my job, it’s my life.") has led him to seek out the best grapes from the finest vineyards in the Napa Valley.  He remains a hands-on artisan who is among the Valley’s most respected winemakers.  Soft-spoken and more inclined to talk about the value of high quality fruit than of winemaker wisdom, Gary continues crafting award winning wines for group and Bourassa Vineyards.</p>
